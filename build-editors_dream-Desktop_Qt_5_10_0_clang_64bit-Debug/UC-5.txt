Throughout my life i have experienced numerous obstacles and life changing events, but if i had to choose one that influenced my achievements both academically and mentally, the event would be the birth of my son. Raising my son for the past two and a half years have been some of the best days of my life. However, at times it can be really difficult to balance being a good father , student, husband , and worker. This huge responsibility has been able to motivate me to endure the “struggle” and do the best that I can in order to succeed in school. Through this difficult task I have gained a drive I’ve never had before. My grades continue to rise and my knowledge only deepens through each class. I am driven to go to a University to educate my son with the knowledge I will acquire there and gain in this life. 
        The challenge of raising a child while building my life has come with a huge amount of responsibility, not only having to manage my time productively but also making time for my family. One of the steps taken to overcome this challenge has been managing my time for school. I devote most of my free time towards learning. Another step has been staying ahead in school, allowing myself to understand the material in depth through time. By staying ahead, I have more time to balance the rest of my responsibilities. Always taking initiative on school work when I am free and still working, paying rent, and spending time with my family has been the most important step. 
This challenge has helped mold me into the person I am today. I have done more in my life with my son in it than without. He has driven me to want more in life and devote myself to finding a place to work where i can utilize my mental capabilities while enjoying time with my family.

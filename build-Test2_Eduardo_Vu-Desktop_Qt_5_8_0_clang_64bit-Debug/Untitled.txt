I have started from the bottom at the community college level and have built my way up to the top. I have sacrificed many nights of sleep and put in so much work and dedication to this major. I’ve shown myself how to study and not simply just memorize how to solve problems. Using what I have learned and applying what I’ve learned to each problem I am faced with. My skills as a student have improved drastically and the people whom I surround myself with have helped me become so much more driven. I have become very focused and determined throughout my community college years and not only have grown as a person but am more mature as a student and a computer scientist. 
	Critical thinking is a huge skill in Computer Science, and being able to have an analytical mind will take me as far as I want to go with my major. By learning the material, instead of memorizing and trying to achieve a grade I can see that if I attack something to learn it, the grade will come along.  Preparing myself and learning each subject with the intent to learn, I now have the skills and tools needed in order to succeed in upper-division courses once I enroll at a university. Rigorous proofs and lots of reading and homework along with side projects have helped me advance in my courses and although I still have a lot to learn, my mindset is ready to tackle anything I am faced with. Through the dedication and school work ethic I have acquired, I know that I can excel in anything I set my mind to.
